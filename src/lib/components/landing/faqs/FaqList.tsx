      While tipping roadside assistance providers is not mandatory in the US,
      it&apos;s a common way to show appreciation for good service, especially
      during inconvenient times or challenging tasks. Tipping is an individual
      decision but is always appreciated for exceptional work.

        Do I need Auto Insurance to use AllDrive SOS?
      </p>
      No! AllDrive SOS offers a convenient pay-as-you-go option. However, if
      your Auto insurance covers roadside assistance, we will provide you with a
      payment receipt via email to help you claim reimbursement from your
      insurance company.

        Can I cancel a pending roadside assistance request and get a refund?
      </p>
      We aim to fulfill every roadside assistance request promptly and
      professionally. However, if you need to cancel a pending request, you can
      do so and receive a refund, subject to a 15% service charge deduction.

      We use secure third-party processors for all transactions, including banks
      and payment gateways. These institutions may charge fees for processing
      refunds, which is why a small service fee applies.
